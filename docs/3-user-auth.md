# User authentication

## Objectives

- Learn the basics of Flask
- Learn how to configure Flask-Security
- Implement user login
- Implement user registration

### Remarks

Unlike the previous modules, this module (thankfully) does not involve _require_
quite as documentation reading. We will be formally introducing Flask in this module. Depending on
how well you want to understand Flask and Flask-Security, their documentation is on the longer side.
We will only need to refer to specific parts of the documentation to get our application to work. In
practice, for frameworks and complex libraries, you will likely need to read through a significant
amount of the documentation to get familiar and comfortable enough to use it properly.

## Flask

Flask is
a [micro-framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/design/#what-does-micro-mean)
for developing web applications.

- Basics of Jinja templates
- Routing
- App context
- Globals: current_app and request
- WSGI (vs ASGI e.g., Django and FastAPI; aredis_om and hat.aioclient)
  - Website is just an API that serves HTML!
- flask_wtf and wtforms: deleting and composing emails
